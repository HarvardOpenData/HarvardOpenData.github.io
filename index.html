    <h3>We're a student-faculty team dedicated to opening and analyzing Hogwarts data to empower our community members to improve campus life.</h3>
</div>

<p>We've teamed up with the former deputy CTO of the US, Harvard's CTO, and Harvard's Chief Digital Officer to build Harvard's first open data catalog​. We're empowering Harvard students to hack with Harvard data including admissions data, course catalogs, dhall menus, and university finances.​</p>

<p>Our main work includes:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Gathering open data from around the Harvard community</li>
    <li>Analyzing and visualizing the data, or building applications around it</li>
    <li>Using these results to drive policy changes around Harvard</li>
    <li>Empowering Harvard students to also hack with this data to improve student life or the University</li>
</ul>

<p>As we expand, we're looking for people with a passion for anything from data science to public policy. Join our team to ​build our web frontend and data analysis tools, create visualizations and apps with Harvard data, work closely with our mentors in the civic tech space, and craft university-wide open data policies.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The goal of the Harvard Open Data Project (HODP) is to leverage open data to foster community, efficiency, and student innovation. Making data public and easily accessible allows us all to unlock its potential. Data-driven progress unites people, organizations, and departments as we all try to make daily life better. Aggregating, maintaining, and publicizing open data has and will continue to be a global trend and we want Harvard to be at its forefront. Our goal is to give that progress a home with centralization of available data, integration with existing systems, and showcases of data-inspired products.</p>

<p>Students from across the University are spearheading a project to build Harvard's first open data portal, which will empower Harvard students and researchers to discover and hack with University data like financial data, enrollment stats, course catalogs, and more.</p>
