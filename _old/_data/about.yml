faq:
    -   question: Why "hathix"?
        answer: |
            It comes from the Hindi हाथी *hathi* for elephant, plus *x* for the box.
            Elephants are my favorite animal, but I still have no idea where the box came from.
    -   question: How'd you start hathix?
        answer: |
            I started learning computer science (JavaScript was my first language!)
            in the summer before my freshman year of high school (summer 2010).
            I made a bunch of software I wanted to [share with the world](games.html),
            so I published it on this site.
    -   question: How'd you make this website?
        answer: |
            I discovered a fantastic tool for website building called
            [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). That and the usual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
            with libraries like jQuery, Angular, and Bootstrap.
            Check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hathix/hathix).
    -   question: Any easter eggs on this site?
        answer: |
            Yeah! Click the "think inside the box" slogan.
    -   question: How's Harvard?
        answer: |
            Better than Yale. But seriously, it's fantastic.
    -   question: Pat's or Geno's?
        answer: |
            This is the one time I regret being vegetarian.
            [Shoo-fly pie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoofly_pie) is good, though.
    -   question: What kind of skateboard do you ride?
        answer: |
            Goldcoast 26" cruiser. Nothing fancy.
    -   question: Favorite sports teams?
        answer: |
            Easily the Philadelphia Phillies. I root for the Red Sox when I go to Fenway.
            Oh, and I support whoever beats the Cowboys.
